# DDIA Part I: Complete Mastery Guide - File Index (Java)

## 🎯 What You'll Actually Build & Learn

This guide is **80% hands-on implementation** and **20% theory**. Each file is focused and complete.

### **Concrete Skills You'll Gain:**
- ✅ **Built your own database storage engine** (hash index, B-tree, LSM-tree implementations)
- ✅ **Implemented data encoding systems** (Protocol Buffers clone, schema evolution handler)
- ✅ **Created performance testing frameworks** for different data models
- ✅ **Debugged real production-style issues** with step-by-step methodologies
- ✅ **Designed and evolved schemas** for complex, changing requirements

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites:**
- **Java 17+** and Maven knowledge
- **Docker** for databases
- **Spring Boot** familiarity helpful
- **2-3 hours per week** for part-time study

### **Quick Setup:**
```bash
# Clone starter repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ddia-java-mastery
cd ddia-java-mastery

# Start databases
docker-compose up -d

# Run first project
cd file1-reliability
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### **Repository Structure:**

## 📋 Learning Path Options

### **🏃‍♂️ Fast Track (8-10 weeks)**
Focus on implementation, skip deep theory:
- File 1 → File 3 → File 4 → File 6 → File 8

### **🎯 Balanced Track (15-20 weeks) - RECOMMENDED**
Theory + extensive implementation:
- All files in order with extra experiments

### **🧠 Deep Track (20+ weeks)**
Research level with contributions:
- All files + academic papers + open source contributions

## 🛠️ What's Different About This Guide

### **Real Code, Not Pseudocode:**
Every example is complete, runnable Java code you can execute and modify.

### **Production Patterns:**
All code follows industry best practices with proper error handling, logging, and testing.

### **Performance Focus:**
Every implementation includes benchmarks and performance analysis.

### **Incremental Complexity:**
Each file builds on previous knowledge but is self-contained.
